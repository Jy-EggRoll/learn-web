    <p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">I am a paragraph with inline styles. I am red and 20px in size. This is not
        recommended as it can make the code harder to maintain and can cause style conflicts. Instead, you should use a
        separate CSS file to define the styles for your HTML elements.</p>
    <p>I am another paragraph. If you want to change the color of the text, you can use the "style" attribute in the "p"
        tag. However, it is not recommended to use inline styles as it can make the code harder to maintain and can
        cause style conflicts. Instead, you should use a separate CSS file to define the styles for your HTML elements.
